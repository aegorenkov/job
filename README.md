# Hello hiring manager
This page is here to allow you to see code samples without getting lost in the resources that I share with friends and students.
Aside from those random resources, my github is relatively empty since I write most of my code on enterprise servers that are not open to the public.

**Propensity Score Matching algorithm implementation in Python and NumPy**

I needed to use statistical matching in the web, but the standard routines in R were too slow. It took 72 hours to do a match on the required data size. There are good proprietary implementations out there, but none that can be used in the web. So I made my own that could run the match within a second.

The code takes several shortcuts to reduce development time and was written under a deadline.

**Interactive cheatsheet**

This is not a code sample, but a simple mobile friendly site written in Ionic which is composed of Angular2 and TypeScript. The idea is that cheatsheets quickly become hard to navigate and could be greatly improved with information retrieval. All Pandas code a descriptions are written by me. No business case here, just a side project that gives me exposure to modern web frameworks.
