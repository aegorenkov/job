# Hello hiring manager
This page is here to allow you to see code samples without getting lost in the resources that I share with friends and students.
Aside from those random resources, my github is relatively empty since I write most of my code on enterprise servers that are not open to the public.

**Propensity Score Matching algorithm implementation in Python and NumPy**
I needed to use statistical matching in the web, but the standard routines in R were too slow. It took 72 hours to do a match on the required data size. There are good proprietary implementations out there, but none that can be used in the web. So I made my own that could run the match within a second.

The code takes several shortcuts to reduce development time.
